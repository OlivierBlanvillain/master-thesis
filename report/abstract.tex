This master project explores the possibilities for enhancement of the Scala.js networking capabilities. JavaScript provides many different API for communication, which while being usable from Scala.js, are non-idiomatic and require substantial integration work. We built the scala-js-transport library to simplify the communication between Scala/Scala.js systems. Featuring a single uniform communication interface, the library allows to build cross platform components, agnostic of a specific transport mechanism, to later plug any of the available implementation for the targeted protocol and platform. We illustrate the possibilities of this library by implementing an online multi player game, available for both desktop and web browser. The game is built around a latency compensation framework using prediction and roll-back mechanisms to provide a responsive user experience.
