The goal of this project is to create a networking library to simplify the communication between browsers running Scala.js and servers running the Play framework. The library should expose a single interface and internally decide which transport mechanism to use, depending on the type of communication and the browser compatibility. One of the main challenges will be to conform to Play's architecture, where requests are load-balanced between multiple stateless servers.
